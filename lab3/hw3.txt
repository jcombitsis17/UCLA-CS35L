Q1. The patch worsens the performance because 32 insertions were added, 
compared to 2 deletions. This results in more instructions for each execution
of ls -aA.

Q2. The patch gets rid of the if statement in case 'A', so now the option -A
always sets ignore_mode = IGNORE_DOT_AND_DOTDOT. This could become a problem
if a user tried to use an option in addition to -A that is not -a. For example
ls -[option] -A may override something that is not intended to be overwritten.

Q3. IndexError: list index out of range
This error is raised because randline.py selects random line(s) by creating a
list containing the file's lines, and accessing a random index. If the file is
empty, then the list has 0 elements, so any index input will raise IndexError.

Q4. SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This error is raised because in Python 3, the syntax for the except keyword
changed, so that commas are no longer valid. Only the format of:
(except IOError as err) is allowed.
